This is the page for querying statistics in the selected variant.
For example if you are caro-kann player you should ask about ECO between B10-B19.

I ask about three variants in caro-kann defense B10, B12, B19. I played B10 Variant 465 times from 2000 games. I won 256 games and lose 209.
I have 226 games in variant B12 and won only 116 games. It's not bad, but I should study this ECO.
