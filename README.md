This is the page for querying statistics in the selected variant.
For example if you are caro-kann player you should enter ECO between B10-B19.

Here is the report of all previous queries. I checked three variants in caro-kann defense - B10, B12, B19. <br>
I played B10 Variant 465 times. I won 256 games and lost 209. <br>
I played B12 Variant 226 times. I won 116 games and lost 110. <br>
I played B19 Variant only 20 times so the results are not relevant. <br>
Based on this report I found my weakness. I should study B12 and find better moves for that variant.
